# SPRING CLOUD MICRO-SERVICES
<br>
<br>
<br>


Client-side service discovery allows services to find and communicate with each other without hard-coding hostname and port. The only â€˜fixed point' in such an architecture consists of a service registry with which each service has to register.

A drawback is that all clients must implement a certain logic to interact with this fixed point. This assumes an additional network round trip before the actual request.

With Netflix Eureka each client can simultaneously act as a server, to replicate its status to a connected peer. In other words, a client retrieves a list of all connected peers of a service registry and makes all further requests to any other services through a load-balancing algorithm.

### TYPES OF MICRO-SERVICES 
<br>
<br>

We've implement the following types of microservices to achieve the goal:

- Service registry (Eureka Server) 
- REST service which registers itself at the registry (Eureka Client)
- Web application, which is consuming the REST service as a registry-aware client (Spring Cloud Netflix Feign Client)
- Spring cloud gateway that provides means for routing requests to different micro-services
